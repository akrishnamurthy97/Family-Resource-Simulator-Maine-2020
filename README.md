# Family-Resource-Simulator-Maine-2020

This repository is from my attempt at building a Family Resource Simulator in R Shiny for the National Center for Children in Poverty. For a few months in 2020, I spent a few hours a week on a volunteer basis trying to draft a version of the center's existing Family Resource Simulator (which is currently programmed in Perl and PHP) using R. This is the progress I made. Credit for the policy-related comments and original Perl code goes to the Center.
